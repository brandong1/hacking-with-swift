//ARRAYS

var evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
var songs = ["Shake it off", "You belong with me", "Back to December"]

//Arrays in Swift work the same in Ruby; they start at index 0.

// songs[0] equals "Shake it off"

// I'm telling Swift I want to store only strings in the array.
var songs: [String] = ["Shake it off", "You Belong with Me", "Back to December"]

// I'm tell Swift I want this array to hold any data type.
var songs: [Any] = ["Shake it off", "You Belong with Me", "Back to December"]
